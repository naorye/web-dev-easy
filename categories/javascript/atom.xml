    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Backbone allows our users to browse our website without refreshing the page. Each page the user visits consists of several Backbone views which are replaced whenever the user navigates. Views reflect our data models and interact with each other. This can be done by listening and triggering events which add functionality to the page. Whenever the view is replaced, there is a need to clean up the removed view, unbind events and remove unmanaged structure. <br/>
This article suggests a solution to the views cleanup problem.<!-- more --> <br/>
Keep in mind that this is only a suggestion as Backbone doesn't bind us to a specific solution. Your solution should be the one that fit your application structure and requirements.</p>

<h2>Cleanup Router</h2>

<p>We want to cleanup views. In order to do this, we have to find where and when a view is not relevant anymore. After thinking a little I understood that this resides somewhere inside the router, the place where views are replaced by other views. Actually, we want to cleanup the view <strong>right before</strong> the navigation. Unfortunately, Backbone.Router has no "before-navigate" event, so we have to override Router's 'navigate()' method and do whatever we want before calling the original 'navigate()' method. Let's define the Router's 'currentView' member as a reference to the current visible view. Then we can do:<br/>
```javascript Backbone.CleanupRouter class first sketch
Backbone.CleanupRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({</p>

<pre><code>navigate: function() {
    if (this.currentView) {
        this.currentView.cleanupAll();
        this.currentView = null;
    }
    Backbone.Router.prototype.navigate.apply(this, arguments);
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
<code>
This way, each time the user navigates between pages, the router calls the current view's 'cleanupAll()' method and then do the navigation.   
In order to let instances of such a router to mark the current view, let's add 'markCurrentView()' method:
</code>javascript Backbone.CleanupRouter class second sketch
Backbone.CleanupRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({</p>

<pre><code>navigate: function(fragment) {
    if (this.currentView) {
        this.currentView.cleanupAll();
        this.currentView = null;
    }
    Backbone.Router.prototype.navigate.apply(this, arguments);
},
markCurrentView: function(view) {
    this.currentView = view;
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
<code>
Now, CleanupRouter's instance can be something like:
</code>javascript Backbone.CleanupRouter instance example
var router = Backbone.CleanupRouter.extend({</p>

<pre><code>routes: {
    'page-a': 'pageA'
},
pageA: function() {
    var view = // create a view for page A
    this.markCurrentView(view);
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
<code>
After looking on the original Backbone.Router's 'navigate()' method, I noticed that there are some cases where the navigate exits without replacing the view (for example, navigation to the same current route should do nothing). In such cases, we don't need to cleanup the current view. Let's change our custom 'navigate()' to exit in those cases:
</code>javascript Backbone.CleanupRouter class final sketch
var routeStripper = /<sup>[#\/]/;</sup>
Backbone.CleanupRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({</p>

<pre><code>navigate: function(fragment) {
    // Filter cases where navigate exists without navigate
    if (!Backbone.History.started) return false;
    var frag = (fragment || '').replace(routeStripper, '');
    if (Backbone.history.fragment == frag) return;

    if (this.currentView) {
        this.currentView.cleanupAll();
        this.currentView = null;
    }
    Backbone.Router.prototype.navigate.apply(this, arguments);
},
markCurrentView: function(view) {
    this.currentView = view;
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<h2>Cleanup View</h2>

<p>Now we have to define a view that has a 'cleanupAll()' method. This view should clean up itself when calling 'cleanupAll()':
```javascript Backbone.CleanupView class first sketch
Backbone.CleanupView = Backbone.View.extend({</p>

<pre><code>cleanup: function() {
    // This method should be overridden by each view and should
    // contains all the cleanup commands
},
cleanupAll: function() {
    this.cleanup();
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
<code>
Backbone views can hold nested views. Whenever we cleanup a view, we need to clean also it's nested views. In order to do that, each view should have a reference to all it's nested views. Let's implement this:
</code>javascript Backbone.CleanupView class last sketch
Backbone.CleanupView = Backbone.View.extend({</p>

<pre><code>constructor: function() {
    this.nestedViews = [];
    Backbone.View.prototype.constructor.apply(this, arguments);
},
setNestedView: function(view) {
    this.nestedViews.push(view);
},
cleanup: function() {
    // This method should be overridden
},
cleanupAll: function() {
    for (var i in this.nestedViews) {
        this.nestedViews[i].cleanup();
    }
    this.nestedViews = null;
    this.cleanup();
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
<code>
Now, CleanupView's instance can be something like:
</code>javascript Backbone.CleanupView instance example
var view = Backbone.CleanupView.extend({</p>

<pre><code>render: function() {
    // Render current view
    var nested = // create a nested view which is
                 // also instance of CleanupView
    this.$el.append(nested.$el);

    this.setNestedView(view);
},
cleanup: function() {
    // Cleanup current view only
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>In order to test our cleanup plugin, I have created a small application that uses it and logs the 'render()' and 'cleanup()' methods. The application contains one router of CleanupRouter type and two views of CleanupView type (with templates):</p>

<p>```javascript Application router
var Router = Backbone.CleanupRouter.extend({</p>

<pre><code>routes: {
    '': 'index',
    'single-view': 'singleView',
    'nested-view': 'nestedView'
},
index: function() {
    this.navigate('single-view', {trigger: true});
},
singleView: function() {
    var view = new SingleView();
    view.render();
    $('#view').empty().append(view.$el);

    this.markCurrentView(view);
},
nestedView: function() {
    var view = new NestedView();
    view.render();
    $('#view').empty().append(view.$el);

    this.markCurrentView(view);
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
```
Our router renders instances of SingleView and NestedView according to the route. After each render we call 'markCurrentView()' in order to mark the current view.</p>

<p>```javascript SingleView view
var SingleView = Backbone.CleanupView.extend({</p>

<pre><code>className: 'single-view',
template: _.template(singleViewTemplate),
render: function() {
    app.log('Render: SingleView (' + this.cid + ')');

    var template = this.template();
    this.$el.html(template);
},
cleanup: function() {
    app.log('Cleanup: SingleView (' + this.cid + ')');
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
<code>
</code>javascript single-view.html template</p>

<h2>Single View</h2>


<p>```
SingleView's template contains only a title. Each time 'render()' and 'cleanup()' are called, the application logs the action.</p>

<p>```javascript NestedView view
var NestedView = Backbone.CleanupView.extend({</p>

<pre><code>className: 'nested-view',
template: _.template(nestedViewTemplate),
events: {
    'click .add-view': 'addView'
},
render: function() {
    app.log('Render: NestedView (' + this.cid + ')');

    var template = this.template();
    this.$el.html(template);
},
cleanup: function() {
    app.log('Cleanup: NestedView (' + this.cid + ')');
},
addView: function() {
    var view = new SingleView();
    this.$el.append(view.$el);
    view.render();
    this.setNestedView(view);
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
<code>
</code>javascript nested-view.html template</p>

<h2>Nested View</h2>


<p><button class="add-view">Add View</button>
```
NestedView's template contains a title and a button. Each time this button is pressed, the view creates and appends to itself a SingleView instance. In addition, by calling 'setNestedView()', the view registers the new SingleView instance to the nested views array. As in SingleView, calls to 'render()' and 'cleanup()' are logged.</p>

<p>You can see the application in action <a target="_blank" href="../code/backbone-cleanup/example/">here</a>. Try to navigate between views and add nested views in order to see in the log how 'render()' and 'cleanup()' take place in the application flow.</p>

    <link href="http://webdeveasy.com/optimize-requirejs-projects/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-19T07:32:00+03:00</updated>
    <id>http://webdeveasy.com/optimize-requirejs-projects</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article will demonstrate you how to concatenate and minify projects that are based on RequireJS. In this article I'll use several tools that require Node.js. So, if you don't have Node.js yet, install it <a target="_blank" href="http://nodejs.org/">here</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>A lot has been written already about RequireJS. This tool allows you to easily separate your JavaScript code into several modules and by this keep your code modular and easy to maintain. Then, you get many JavaScript files that have dependency relation. By adding one script reference to RequireJS in your html file, you can load all the required scripts for your page. <br/>
Still, in production, this is a bad practice to leave all JavaScript files separated. Making many requests, no matter how small the requested files are, take time. This time can be saved by concatenating scripts that reduce the number of requests and save the loading time. <br/>
Another technique to save loading time is to reduce the size of the requested files, a small file can be delivered faster. This process is called <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_%28programming%29">minification</a> and it is done by carefully changing the script's code without changing its behavior and functionality. Such changes can be: removing unnecessary characters like spaces, mangling variables and methods names and so on.
This process of concatenation and minification is called optimization. In addition to JavaScript files optimization, the same methods are used to optimize CSS files. <br/>
RequireJS has two main methods: define() and require(). These methods basically have similar declaration and they both know to load dependencies and then execute a callback function.
Unlike require(), define() is used to store code as a named module. Therefore the define()'s callback function should return a value to define the module. Such modules are called <a target="_blank" href="http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html">AMD</a> (Asynchronous Module Definition).</p>

<p>If you are not familiar with RequireJS or didn't fully understand what I wrote - don't worry. An example is about to come.</p>

<h2>JavaScript Application Optimization</h2>

<p>In this section I will demonstrate the optimization of Addy Osmani's <a target="_blank" href="http://todomvc.com/dependency-examples/backbone_require/">TodoMVC Backbone.js + RequireJS project</a>. Since the TodoMVC project contains many implementations of TodoMVC in different frameworks, I downloaded version 1.1.0 and draw out the Backbone.js + RequireJS application. Download the application from
<a target="_blank" href="../code/optimize-requirejs-projects/todo-mvc.zip">here</a> and extract the zip file. The extracted todo-mvc directory will be our example root path and from now on I'll refer to this directory as &lt;root&gt;. <br/>
If you'll look on &lt;root&gt;/index.html file, you will see it contains only one script tag (and another one if you use Internet Explorer):
```html index.html scripts refrences</p>

<script data-main="js/main" src="js/lib/require/require.js"></script>


<!--[if IE]>
    <script src="js/lib/ie.js"></script>
<![endif]-->


<p>```
In fact, the only tag required for loading the whole project's scripts is the require.js script tag. If you'll launch <a target="_blank" href="../code/optimize-requirejs-projects/todo-mvc/">the project</a> in your browser and look under the network tab of your favorite inspection tool, you will notice that your browser has also loaded other JavaScript files: <br/>
<img class="right" src="/code/optimize-requirejs-projects/loaded-js-files-list.png" title="Loaded JavaScript Files List" alt="Loaded JavaScript Files List"> <br/>
All the scripts marked inside the red square were loaded by RequireJS.</p>

<p>To optimize the project we will use <a target="_blank" href="http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html">RequireJS Optimizer</a>. Follow the <a target="_blenk" href="http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html#download">download instructions</a>, get r.js and copy it to the &lt;root&gt; directory. jrburke's <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jrburke/r.js">r.js</a> is a command line tool that can run AMD based projects, but what is more important, it includes the RequireJS Optimizer which allows us to concatenate and minify scripts.<br/>
RequireJS Optimizer has many usages. It can optimize single JavaScript or single CSS file, it can optimize a whole project or only part of it as well as multi-page application. It can also use different minification engines or no minification at all, and so on. This article has no intention to cover all the possibilities of RequireJS Optimizer, but to demonstrate a usage.</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, we will use Node.js in order to run the optimizer. The following command runs it:
<code>bash Run RequireJS Optimizer
$ node r.js -o &lt;arguments&gt;
</code>
There are two ways to supply arguments to the optimizer. One way is to specify arguments on the command line:
<code>bash Arguments on the command line
$ node r.js -o baseUrl=. name=main out=main-built.js
</code>
Other way is to specify a build profile file (relative to the execution folder) that contains the arguments:
<code>bash Arguments on build profile file
$ node r.js -o build.js
</code>
And build.js content:
```javascript Arguments on build profile file
({</p>

<pre><code>baseUrl: ".",
name: "main",
out: "main-built.js"
</code></pre>

<p>})
<code>
I think a build profile file is more readable than command line arguments so I'll use this method. Let's create our &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/build.js file and see which arguments it contains:
</code>javascript &lt;root&gt;/build.js
({</p>

<pre><code>appDir: './',
baseUrl: './js',
dir: './dist',
modules: [
    {
        name: 'main'
    }
],
fileExclusionRegExp: /^(r|build)\.js$/,
optimizeCss: 'standard',
removeCombined: true,
paths: {
    jquery: 'lib/jquery',
    underscore: 'lib/underscore',
    backbone: 'lib/backbone/backbone',
    backboneLocalstorage: 'lib/backbone/backbone.localStorage',
    text: 'lib/require/text'
},
shim: {
    underscore: {
        exports: '_'
    },
    backbone: {
        deps: [
            'underscore',
            'jquery'
        ],
        exports: 'Backbone'
    },
    backboneLocalstorage: {
        deps: ['backbone'],
        exports: 'Store'
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>})
```</p>

<p>Understanding all the configurations of RequireJS Optimizer is not the aim of this article, but I want do describe the arguments I used:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Argument            </th>
<th> Description </th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>appDir              </td>
<td> The directory that contains the application (the &lt;root&gt; directory). All the files sitting under this directory will be copied from here to the dir argument.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>baseUrl             </td>
<td> A path, relative to appDir, that represents the anchor path for finding files.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>dir                 </td>
<td> This is the output directory which all the application files will be copied to.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>modules             </td>
<td> Array that contains objects. Each object represents a module that should be optimize.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>fileExclusionRegExp </td>
<td> Each file or directory that will be match to this regular expression will not be copied to our output directory. Since we located r.js and build.js under the application directory, we want the optimizer to exclude them. Therefore we set this argument to /&#94;(r|build)&#92;.js$/.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>optimizeCss         </td>
<td> RequireJS Optimizer automatically optimizes our application's CSS files. This argument controls the CSS optimization settings. Allowed values: "none", "standard", "standard.keepLines", "standard.keepComments", "standard.keepComments.keepLines".</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>removeCombined      </td>
<td> If true, optimizer will remove concatenated files from the output directory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>paths               </td>
<td> Relative paths of modules.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>shim                </td>
<td> Configure dependencies and exports for "browser globals" scripts, that do not use define() to declare the dependencies and set a module value.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>


<p>For more information and for advanced usage of the RequireJS Optimizer, in addition to it's web page provided earlier, you can read the details of all the allowed optimizer configuration options <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/build/example.build.js">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now that we have the build file, lets run the optimizer. Go to the &lt;root&gt; directory and execute the command:</p>

<p><code>bash Run optimizer
$ node r.js -o build.js
</code>
A new folder has created: &lt;root&gt;/dist. It is important to notice that the script &lt;root&gt;/dist/js/main.js now contains all it's combined and minified dependencies. Moreover, &lt;root&gt;/dist/css/base.css is also optimized. <br/>
Running <a target="_blank" href="../code/optimize-requirejs-projects/todo-mvc/dist/">the optimized project</a> launches the application which looks exactly like the non-optimized version. Inspecting the page network traffic will show that only two JavaScript files were loaded:
<img class="right" src="/code/optimize-requirejs-projects/loaded-optimized-js-files-list.png" title="Loaded Optimized JavaScript Files List" alt="Loaded Optimized JavaScript Files List"> <br/>
RequireJs Optimizer reduced the amount of server scripts requests from 13 to 2 and reduced the total scripts size from 164KB to 58.6KB (both require.js and main.js).</p>

<h2>Overhead</h2>

<p>Apparently, after the optimization is over, we don't need a reference to require.js because the scripts are no longer separated and all the dependencies were loaded. <br/>
Still, the optimization process concatenated all our scripts and produced one optimized script file which contains many calls to define() and require(). Therefore, to allow the application work properly, define() and require() must be specified and
implemented somewhere in our application. <br/>
This issue causes a well known overhead: we always have to have any code that implement define() and require(). <strong>This code is not part of our application and it exists only due to our infrastructure considerations.</strong> This problem becomes even bigger when we want to develop a JavaScript library. Such libraries usually have small size comparing to RequireJS itself, and therefore including it in the library will cause a huge overhead.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this article, there isn't any full solution for this overhead, but we can ease it using <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jrburke/almond">almond</a>. Almond is a minimalistic AMD loader which implements the RequireJS API, and so, instead of including the RequireJS implementation in our optimized code, we can include almond. <br/>
Nowadays, I am working on an optimizer that will be able to optimize RequireJS applications without overhead, but this is still a new project so there is nothing to show yet.</p>

    <link href="http://webdeveasy.com/object-oriented-programming-with-javascript/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-18T23:01:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://webdeveasy.com/object-oriented-programming-with-javascript</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As we already know, JavaScript is an object oriented language. In this article we will see JavaScript example to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28object-oriented_programming%29" target="_blank">inheritance</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_in_object-oriented_programming" target="_blank">subtype polymorphism</a>.<!-- more -->
For solid base, I really recommend to read first about <a href="../javascript-prototype">JavaScript Prototype</a>.</p>

<h2>Base Class</h2>

<p>Lets define an Animal class. First thing to do is to define it's constructor:
```javascript Animal constructor
var Animal = function() {</p>

<pre><code>this.color = "Pink";
</code></pre>

<p>}
<code>
Next, lets define Animal's methods:
</code>javascript Animal methods
Animal.prototype.run = function() {</p>

<pre><code>console.log("Wuuuuuuuuuuuuushhhhhh");
</code></pre>

<p>}
Animal.prototype.sleep = function() {</p>

<pre><code>console.log("ZZZzzzZZZzzzZZZzzzzzz...");
</code></pre>

<p>}
Animal.prototype.eat = function() {</p>

<pre><code>console.log("HmnmnmHmmnmnm..BURP");
</code></pre>

<p>}
<code>
An easy way to write this is to extend Animal.prototype (using &lt;a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/" target="_blank"&gt;jQuery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://underscorejs.org/#extend" target="_blank"&gt;underscore&lt;/a&gt; or your own implementation):
</code>javascript Animal methods using jQuery.extend
$.extend(Animal.prototype, {</p>

<pre><code>run: function() {
    console.log("Wuuuuuuuuuuuuushhhhhh");
},
sleep: function() {
    console.log("ZZZzzzZZZzzzZZZzzzzzz...");
},
eat: function() {
    console.log("HmnmnmHmmnmnm..BURP");
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
```
Great, this looks better. Now we can create animals that can run, sleep and eat.</p>

<h2>Sub Class - Inharitance</h2>

<p>Lets create a Cat which is a sub class of an Animal. First create Cat's constructor:
```javascript Cat constructor
var Cat = function() {</p>

<pre><code>Animal.apply(this, arguments); // Call parent class constructor

this.name = name;
console.log("My name is " + this.name +
            " and my color is " + this.color);
</code></pre>

<p>}
<code>
Next, we want Cat to have Animal's methods, so we need something like:
</code>javascript Cat's prototype gets Animal's prototype
Cat.prototype = Animal.prototype;
```
But this code will cause a problem. Adding new methods to Cat's prototype will add those methods also to Animal (since Cat.prototype and Animal.prototype are now refrence to the same set of methods). <br/>
There are a few ways to solve this problem:</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        Use Object.create method that creates an object based on set of properties:

```javascript Using Object.create
Cat.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
```
    </li>
    <li>
        Use extend:

```javascript Using extend
$.extend(Cat.prototype, Animal.prototype);
```
    </li>
    <li>
        Dance a little:

```javascript Dancing
var sub = function() { };
sub.prototype = Animal.prototype;
Cat.prototype = new sub();
```
    </li>
</ol>


<p>Lets add methods to Cat:
```javascript Add methods to Cat
$.extend(Cat.prototype, {</p>

<pre><code>drinkMilk: function() {
    consoloe.log("lplplplplplp");
},
fightOtherCat: function() {
    console.log("Mirrrrrrrccchhhhh");
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
<code>
Finally, Cat definition looks like this:
</code>javascript Cat definition
var Cat = function() {</p>

<pre><code>Animal.apply(this, arguments);

this.name = name;
console.log("My name is " + this.name +
            " and my color is " + this.color);
</code></pre>

<p>}
Cat.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
$.extend(Cat.prototype, {</p>

<pre><code>drinkMilk: function() {
    console.log("lplplplplplp");
},
fightOtherCat: function() {
    console.log("Mirrrrrrrccchhhhh");
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
<code>
So, meybe it will be easier to create inheritance helper:
</code>javascript Inheritance helper
function inherit(base, methods) {</p>

<pre><code>var sub = function() {
    base.apply(this, arguments); // Call base class constructor

    // Call sub class initialize method that will act like a constructor
    this.initialize.apply(this, arguments);
};
sub.prototype = Object.create(base.prototype);
$.extend(sub.prototype, methods);
return sub;
</code></pre>

<p>}
<code>
Now creating Cat using the new helper is really simple and clear:
</code>javascript Cat definition using our inheritance helper
var Cat = inherit(Animal, {</p>

<pre><code>initialize: function(name) {
    this.name = name;
    console.log("My name is " + this.name +
                " and my color is " + this.color);
},
drinkMilk: function() {
    console.log("lplplplplplp");
},
fightOtherCat: function() {
    console.log("Mirrrrrrrccchhhhh");
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<h2>Sub Class - Subtype Polymorphism</h2>

<p>Since cats are purring when they sleep, lets override the sleep method:
```javascript Override base class method
var Cat = inherit(Animal, {</p>

<pre><code>...
...
...
sleep: function() {
    console.log("rrr...rrr...rrr...");
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
<code>
But, what if after purring, cats getting sleep like any other animal?   
Lets call the Animal's sleep method right after purring:
</code>javascript Calling base class method
var Cat = inherit(Animal, {</p>

<pre><code>...
...
...
sleep: function() {
    console.log("rrr...rrr...rrr...");
    Animal.prototype.sleep();
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
```
Now out cat will sleep like any other animal after purring a little.</p>

<h2>Complete Code</h2>

<p>Here is our complete code:
```javascript Complete code
function inherit(base, methods) {</p>

<pre><code>var sub = function() {
    base.apply(this, arguments); // Call base class constructor

    // Call sub class initialize method that will act like a constructor
    this.initialize.apply(this, arguments);
};
sub.prototype = Object.create(base.prototype);
$.extend(sub.prototype, methods);
return sub;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>var Animal = function() {</p>

<pre><code>this.color = "Pink";
</code></pre>

<p>}
$.extend(Animal.prototype, {</p>

<pre><code>run: function() {
    console.log("Wuuuuuuuuuuuuushhhhhh");
},
sleep: function() {
    console.log("ZZZzzzZZZzzzZZZzzzzzz...");
},
eat: function() {
    console.log("HmnmnmHmmnmnm..BURP");
}
</code></pre>

<p>});</p>

<p>var Cat = inherit(Animal, {</p>

<pre><code>initialize: function(name) {
    this.name = name;
    console.log("My name is " + this.name +
                " and my color is " + this.color);
},
drinkMilk: function() {
    consoloe.log("lplplplplplp");
},
fightOtherCat: function() {
    console.log("Mirrrrrrrccchhhhh");
},
sleep: function() {
    console.log("rrr...rrr...rrr...");
    Animal.prototype.sleep();
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>Since I have a cat, I must create its virtual persona:
<code>javascript My virtual Mutzi
var mutzi = new Cat("Mutzi");
mutzi.run();
mutzi.fightOtherCat();
mutzi.sleep();
</code>
And of course, the result will appear on the console:
<code>
My name is Mutzi and my color is Pink
Wuuuuuuuuuuuuushhhhhh
Mirrrrrrrccchhhhh
rrr...rrr...rrr...
ZZZzzzZZZzzzZZZzzzzzz...
</code></p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>In this article we created the Animal base class. Then we created the Cat sub class by inherit from Animal. Then we added new methods for Cat and at the end we overridden Animal's method and used the base class implementation in our implementation.</p>

<p>I hope you had fun reading this article! <br/>
Any questions -> to me :)</p>

    <link href="http://webdeveasy.com/backbone-cache/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-12T22:37:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://webdeveasy.com/backbone-cache</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Caching collections and models in Backbone allows to save server calls and return the result faster to the user. This means happier server and happier users. This article will guide you how to implement Backbone caching.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In order to support caching in Backbone, first, I've created a Cache class that has the basic cache behavior and knows to cache key-value items. Then, I've created Backbone.CachedModel and Backbone.CachedCollection classes and override their fetch method so it will search the cache before fetching from the server.</p>

<h2>Cache Class</h2>

<p>```javascript Backbone.Cache class
Backbone.Cache = function() {</p>

<pre><code>this.store = {};
</code></pre>

<p>};
$.extend(Backbone.Cache.prototype, Backbone.Events, {</p>

<pre><code>set: function(key, value) {
    this.trigger("set", key, value);
    this.store[key] = value;
},
has: function(key) {
    var isHas = !!this.store[key];
    this.trigger("has", key, isHas);
    return isHas;
},
get: function(key) {
    var value = this.store[key];
    this.trigger("get", key, value);
    return value;
},
remove: function(key) {
    var value = this.store[key];
    this.trigger("remove", key, value);
    delete this.store[key];
    return value;
},
clear: function() {
    this.trigger("clear");
    this.store = {};
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
```
Each Cache instance holds an object that stored the data, and its methods manage this object. Cache also extends from Backbone.Events so it would be able to listen to events and trigger some.</p>

<h2>Fetch Cache</h2>

<p>In order to cache fetching results of a model, we need to know the key of the cache item and the cache object instance in which the item stored in. Therefore, each model or collection that needs caching has to define two properties: cacheKey and cacheObject.
Lets create Backbone.CachedModel and override it's fetch method. Backbone.CachedCollection's new fetch is pretty much the same.</p>

<p>```javascript Backbone.Model fetch override
Backbone.CachedModel = Backbone.Model.extend({</p>

<pre><code>fetch: function(options) {
    // If the model has required info for cache
    if (this.cacheKey &amp;&amp; this.cacheObject) {
        options = options || {};
        var cacheObject = this.cacheObject,
            cacheKey = this.cacheKey,
            success = options.success;

        // Checking whether the cache object already holds the required data
        if (cacheObject.has(cacheKey)) {
            var resp = cacheObject.get(cacheKey);

            // Do the same as the fetch method does when the data received
            this.set(this.parse(resp, options), options);
            if (success) success(this, resp, options);

            // Returns deferred as the original fetch
            return $.Deferred().resolve();
        } else {
            // The cache object doesn't hold the required data
            // Preparing success method that set the cache 
            options.success = function(entity, resp, options) {
                cacheObject.set(cacheKey, resp);
                if (success) success(entity, resp, options);
            };
            // Calling the original fetch
            return Backbone.Model.prototype.fetch.call(this, options);
        }
    } else {
        // No cache for this model, calling the original fetch
        return Backbone.Model.prototype.fetch.call(this, options);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>});
```
That's all! now, each model or collection that has cacheKey and cacheObject properties now cached.</p>

<h2>Usage Example</h2>

<p>First, there must define a cache object. There can be more then cache objects according to the need. For example, application global cache for caching application data or user cache for caching session user data.</p>

<p><code>javascript Define global application cache
app.globalCache = new Backbone.Cache();
</code></p>

<p>Next, define the model and set cacheKey and cacheObject. In this example app.globalCache is used to cache the fetch results. Also, the results will be cached with the key "UserPermissions_X" (X is the user id).</p>

<p>```javascript Define UserPermissions model
var UserPermissions = Backbone.CachedModel.extend({</p>

<pre><code>cacheObject: app.globalCache,
initialize: function() {
    var userId = this.get('id');
    if (userId) {
        this.cacheKey = "UserPermissions_" + userId;
    }
},
urlRoot: 'api/user/permissions'
</code></pre>

<p>});
```</p>

<p>Now, somewhere in the application, call fetch to get the user permissions. The fetch method will ask the server for the data and then cache it.</p>

<p><code>javascript Fetch user permissions
var user1Permissions = new UserPermissions({ id: 1 });
user1Permissions.fetch();
</code></p>

<p>Later in the application, there is a need to get again the user permissions. calling fetch will immediately retrieve the user permissions from the cache object.</p>

<p><code>javascript Get user permissions from cache
var permissions = new UserPermissions({ id: 1 });
permissions.fetch();
</code></p>

<p>The index.html file contains the layout of our application which include placeholders for the search section, the history section and the search results area. It also includes reference to css file and reference to the require.js script.
When the browser loads this html file, right after loading style.css, the browser loads the require.js script. Look closely and you'll notice that require.js script tag has additional attribute called "data-main". This attribute tells require.js to load js/main.js after require.js loads.</p>

<h3>js/main.js</h3>

<p>This file contains two sections:</p>

<ul>
<li>Configuration section that configure the require.js paths and modules.</li>
<li>Initialization section that initialize the application.</li>

<p>require.js configuration allows us to map modules paths to names. For example, jQuery.js file is located in "libs/jquery-1.8.2.min". Whenever we wish mark jQuery as a dependency, we will have to write this long path. Since jQuery is basic module and we probably use it a lot, it is better to map its path. <br/>
require.js works with <a href="http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html" target="_blank">AMD modules</a>. The AMD structure tells require.js what are the dependencies and which object to return. The purpose of the shim configuration is to tell require.js for each un-AMD module what is its dependencies and which object to return. <br/>
After the configurations done, we ask require.js to load Backbone, router.js and app.js, and after that execute the initialization function. This function gets as parameters the AMD modules that require.js required to resolve and initializes the router, initializes the app and starts Backbone.history.</p>

<p>Lets see what app.js initialization function does:</p>

<ul>
<li>Keeps reference of the router and initializes instance of QueryModel. This appQuery instance acts as a singleton and every time it changes, the router changes the url to "search/&lt;sourceId&gt;/&lt;term&gt;" (without trigger a route event).</li>
<li>Initializes the main views of the application - SearchView and HistoryView.</li>
<li>Creates two new search sources. For each source it is necessary to know it's name, id (for internal purposes) and it's main view. Later we will discuss on the sources feature.</li>
<li>Creates sourceManager that knows manage search sources (we will discuss on it later also) and adds to it the two search sources.</li>
<li>Adds the two search sources to the search view.</li>
</ul>


<p>At this point, the application loading flow is over and now the application waits for user interaction.
In order to understand completely how everything bonds together and works, we must understand the application features and components.</p>

<p>The router depends on app.js. Whenever a route in form "search/&lt;sourceId&gt;/&lt;term&gt;" is entered to the url, the router trigger the searchImages() method which changes the appQuery singleton.</p>

<h2>Application Features and Components</h2>

<p>Now it is time to review the searching, sources and the history features.</p>

<h3>Searching</h3>

<p>The main purpose of the application is to allow searching. The application makes searches among different search providers, therefore the input it gets from the user contains a search term and a search provider. So, we need a model to store this information. Actually, a single instance of this model will serve us during the entire use of the application. Each time the user makes a different search (change the search term or provider), the model instance changes. Later, those model changes will trigger the search.</p>

<p>QueryModel has two attributes. "term" for holding the search term and "sourceId" for holding the search provider. The default value for both attributes are the empty string.</p>

<p>SearchView view creates the inputs and adds the behavior of the searching process.</p>

<p>SearchView renders itself on initialization, and every time appQuery changes it updates the input values. On render, the view draws itself using <a href="http://underscorejs.org/#template" target="_blank">underscore templates</a> and initializes the inputs according to the appQuery. Whenever the user clicks on the search button, the view set appQuery with the new values which causing the url to change (as we saw in app.js). Notice that SearchView uses the text plugin of require.js in order to load templates/search.html. In addition, the compiled version of templates are stored in searchTemplate and in optionTemplate in order to save compilations. SearchView contains the addSource() method which gets sourceModel instance as parameter (we will see it later) and adds the new source to the sources select list.</p>

<h3>Sources</h3>

<p>As I mentioned before, the application makes searches among different search providers. The sources mechanism is responsible for defining search providers, their models and their views. This feature includes the SourcesManager view which acts as a bridge and responsible for rendering the relevant search results according to appQuery.</p>

<p>When initialized with appQuery as model, SourcesManager renders itself on appQuery change. SourceManager has the ability to add sources using the addSource() function or using the initialization "sources" option. When it renders, it resolves the search provider's view according to appQuery and renders it.
SourceManager initialization occurs inside the application initialization:
```javascript SourcesManager initialization</p>

<pre><code>this.sourcesManager = new SourcesManager( {
    el: '.content',
    model: this.appQuery,
    sources: [
        new SourceModel({
            id: 'library-of-congress',
            name: 'Library Of Congress',
            view: LocGridView
        }),
        new SourceModel({
            id: 'google-shopping',
            name: 'Google Shopping',
            view: GoogleListView
        })
    ]
});
</code></pre>

<p>```
appQuery is the SourcesManager model and the search results are rendered inside ".content" element. The search providers are also defined here using the SourceModel. Each search provider should have id, name and main view which will be displayed when selected.</p>

<p>The search results structure defined inside the products.html as a table that contains all the products. For each product, a new product row with thumbnail, title and description is created.
Search providers can contain many views. When defining the search provider in SourcesManager, we must tell which view is the main view to display. ListView is the main view of the Google Shopping search provider.</p>

<p>ListView initializes ProductsCollection and on render fetch it and append the results to el. In case of an error or empty results, a relevant text message appears. Behind the scenes, the fetch method uses the jQuery.ajax function and the data option is passed to it. The data option contains needed properties for the Google Shopping api. Keep in mind that in your application you will need to use yours Google api key.
Now, whenever the user chooses Google Shopping as a search provider, SourcesManager initializes ListView which fetches the results and display them inside ".content" element.</p>

<h3>History</h3>

<p>Another feature of this application is history. The application stores queries history and enables us to make searches from history. In order to store the queries history we need a collection of QueryModel:</p>

<p>HistoryView gets appQuery as a model, and on initialization it creates QueriesCollection instance. Whenever the appQuery changes, the view adds it to queries collection and renders itself. Render takes the queries collection and generates the markup from the queriesListTemplate dependency. Whenever the user click on history entry, the setModel() function triggered and set appQuery with the history values. As a result of appQuery change, SourcesManager's render occurred.</p>
